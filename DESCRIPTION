Description: This R package provides functions for designing sequencing panels.
A sequencing panel is a collection of genomic regions selected for targeted 
sequencing, such as cancer hotspot mutations.
Given a cohort of individuals with associated genomic features 
(e.g., patients with somatic mutations), the typical objective is to design a 
panel that captures the largest number of individuals while using the smallest 
possible subset of features.
