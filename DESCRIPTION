Description: This R package contains a collection of scripts to design gene or 
  genomic region panels. A panel is essentially a set of genomic regions of 
  interest. Given data of individuals associated with genomic features (e.g. 
  patients and mutations), a goal can be to design a panel containing a minimal 
  subset of features to cover a maximum number of individuals.
